      "content": "Foxconn, the maker of Apple's iPhones, has announced plans to produce electric vehicles (EV) for Japanese car giant Mitsubishi Motors. Under a new agreement in principle, Foxconn's EV joint venture, Foxtron, will design and manufacture vehicles in Taiwan specifically for Mitsubishi. The companies aim to have the new model ready by the end of next year, marking Foxconn’s first major deal in the EV sector.\n\nThe collaboration represents a significant step for both companies. Foxtron, a joint venture between Foxconn and Taiwanese car maker Yulon Motor, will be responsible for the car's design and manufacturing management. The resulting EVs are expected to enter the Australian and New Zealand markets in the second half of 2026.\n\nCurrently, the deal is a memorandum of understanding—a non-binding agreement—though both parties confirmed they will continue discussions toward a final contract. Foxconn, known as the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer and a key Apple supplier, has shown growing interest in the automobile sector, including previous talks with Nissan.\n\nMitsubishi Motors is part of a broader automotive alliance with Nissan and Renault. The partnership comes as Japanese automakers face increasing pressure from rapidly growing Chinese EV brands like BYD, especially in regions such as South East Asia, South America, and Europe.\n\nThis move reflects the global shift toward electrification and the intensifying competition in the EV market, where established brands are seeking innovative ways to keep up with China’s swift advancements.",

This move could challenge Google's long-standing dominance in the search market, especially as it pays Apple approximately $20 billion annually to remain the default engine.\n\nApple executive Eddy Cue, during his testimony in the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google, stated that Safari searches declined last month due to users increasingly using AI tools. This shift signals growing interest in AI alternatives like OpenAI and Perplexity.\n\nApple has already partnered with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT into Siri, and Google is working on securing a deal to integrate Gemini AI into Apple devices by mid-year. Analysts believe that even if Google loses its exclusive default position on Safari, it could face serious consequences in the digital ad space.\n\nCue mentioned that Apple would consider adding AI search engines to Safari's list of search providers, although they may not replace Google as the default. As Apple leans further into AI, the traditional search landscape may face a major disruption.",

Ofcom has not yet categorized any services but has requested information from Wikipedia.\n\nThe Foundation fears that if Wikipedia is designated as a Category 1 service, it may be forced to verify editors' identities, potentially endangering their privacy and safety. This could discourage contributions, especially to sensitive or controversial topics. Wikipedia argues the regulations risk both overregulating low-risk sites like theirs and missing more harmful platforms.\n\nLegal experts say Wikimedia faces a high bar to overturn the regulations.

How should it have a 'legitimate interest' to suck up all data for AI training?\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"We are currently evaluating our options to file injunctions, but there is also the option for a subsequent class action for non-material damages. If you think about the more than 400 million European Meta users who could all demand damages of just 500 euros or so, you can do the math,\" Schrems said.\nNOYB said an injunction could be filed under the EU Collective Redress which enables consumers to pursue collective lawsuits against companies in the bloc. It set a May 21 deadline for Meta to respond.\nNOYB, which last year called on EU privacy enforcers to act, said Meta could give users an option to opt-in rather than opt-out and also provide clear conditions for AI training such as using anonymised user data, in line with EU privacy rules.",

The company let a small number of staff go in January over performance-related issues, but the new cuts are not related to that, according to CNBC, which first reported the news.",

Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year, as it looks to control costs and prioritize AI, media reports have said.\n\"We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said on mail.\nThe company, which had 228,000 workers as of June last year, regularly uses layoffs to prioritize staffing in its main focus areas.\nTuesday's move comes weeks after Microsoft posted stronger-than-expected growth in its cloud-computing business Azure and blowout results in the latest quarter, calming investor worries in an uncertain economy.\n\nBut the cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on profitability, with Microsoft Cloud margins narrowing to 69% in the March quarter from 72% a year ago.\nMicrosoft has earmarked $80 billion in capital spending this fiscal year, with most of it aimed at expanding data centers to ease capacity bottlenecks for artificial intelligence services.\nD.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said the layoffs showed Microsoft was \"very closely\" managing the margin pressure created by its heightened AI investments.\n\"We believe that every year Microsoft invests at the current levels, it would need to reduce headcount by at least 10,000 in order to make up for the higher depreciation levels due to their capital expenditures,\" he said.",

      "summary": "Many individuals continue using outdated Windows systems due to hardware limitations, software compatibility, or personal preference, despite potential security risks and lack of support from Microsoft.",
      "content": "Despite advancements in technology, a segment of users remains reliant on older Windows operating systems like Windows 7 or even Windows XP. Reasons for this persistence include hardware constraints, as older machines may not support newer OS requirements, and specific software dependencies that are incompatible with modern systems. Additionally, some users prefer the familiarity and simplicity of legacy interfaces.\n\nHowever, continuing to use outdated systems poses significant risks. Microsoft has ceased support for these older versions, meaning no security updates or technical assistance are provided. This lack of support leaves systems vulnerable to malware and other security threats. Furthermore, compatibility issues with newer applications and peripherals can hinder productivity and functionality.\n\nWhile the nostalgia and practicality of older systems are understandable, users are encouraged to consider upgrading to supported versions to ensure security and compatibility. For those unable to upgrade, implementing robust security measures and limiting internet exposure can help mitigate some risks.",
