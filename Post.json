        "content": "Foxconn, the maker of Apple's iPhones, has announced plans to produce electric vehicles (EV) for Japanese car giant Mitsubishi Motors. Under a new agreement in principle, Foxconn's EV joint venture, Foxtron, will design and manufacture vehicles in Taiwan specifically for Mitsubishi. The companies aim to have the new model ready by the end of next year, marking Foxconn’s first major deal in the EV sector.\n\nThe collaboration represents a significant step for both companies. Foxtron, a joint venture between Foxconn and Taiwanese car maker Yulon Motor, will be responsible for the car's design and manufacturing management. The resulting EVs are expected to enter the Australian and New Zealand markets in the second half of 2026.\n\nCurrently, the deal is a memorandum of understanding—a non-binding agreement—though both parties confirmed they will continue discussions toward a final contract. Foxconn, known as the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer and a key Apple supplier, has shown growing interest in the automobile sector, including previous talks with Nissan.\n\nMitsubishi Motors is part of a broader automotive alliance with Nissan and Renault. The partnership comes as Japanese automakers face increasing pressure from rapidly growing Chinese EV brands like BYD, especially in regions such as South East Asia, South America, and Europe.\n\nThis move reflects the global shift toward electrification and the intensifying competition in the EV market, where established brands are seeking innovative ways to keep up with China’s swift advancements.",

This malware is spread via fake CAPTCHA lures resembling ClickFix pop-ups. \n\nAccording to Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), LOSTKEYS is designed to steal specific file types from targeted directories and collect sensitive system data, including running processes. The malware has been active in January, March, and April of 2025.\n\nIts targets include Western government and military advisors (both current and former), journalists, think tanks, NGOs, and Ukrainian-affiliated individuals. This marks a shift in COLDRIVER’s strategy, which previously focused on credential phishing. \n\nLOSTKEYS is the second malware attributed to the group, following SPICA. COLDRIVER is also known by aliases like Callisto, Star Blizzard, and UNC4057, and remains a persistent threat in the geopolitical cyber landscape.",
